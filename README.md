# LoLTrainer

Description
-----------
Free open source [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/) trainer made by exploiting images recognition.
This software is strongly dependent on 
[League of Legends Fandom Wiki](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki) for what concerns
**images** and **stats**.

LoLTrainer Purpose
------------------
The main reason behind this project is because I didn't want to use League of Legends official
[API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) (for obvious reasons). In addition, I'm having a lot of
fun!

Installation
------------
To do, I guess I'll simply create an .exe.


How to Use
----------
To do.
